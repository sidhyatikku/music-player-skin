# iPod Classic Interface 🔥

*Automatically synced with your [v0.app](https://v0.app) deployments*

## Overview

Back in the day, I used to download Windows Media Player skins and play my music through them, my music playing experience was customized and enhanced by them. Recently, I had the epiphany of somehow enhacing my experience via Spotify/YouTube and instead of skins, I'm using old school devices which I had.
